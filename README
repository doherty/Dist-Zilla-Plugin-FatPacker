SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

        [FatPacker]
        script = bin/my_script

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin uses App::FatPacker to pack your dependencies onto your
    script file.

 munge_file

    When processing the script file indicated by the script configuration
    parameter, it prepends its packed dependencies to the script.

    This process creates temporary files outside the build directory, but
    if there are no errors, they will be removed again.

 safe_pipe_command

    Runs a command in a pipe, and returns the stdout.

 safe_remove_tree

    A wrapper around remove_tree() from File::Path that adds some error
    checks.

 safe_system

    A wrapper around system() that adds some error checks.
